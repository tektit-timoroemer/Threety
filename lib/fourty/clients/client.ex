defmodule Fourty.Clients.Client do
  @moduledoc """

  The Clients schema holds information about the clients in the system:
  at this time, this information consists only of the label (string)
  which can be used to identify a specific client, for example by name.

  For each client, you may add one or more `projects`.

  When a client is deleted, all its projects will be deleted as well.

  ## Fields

    - label: must be a unique identifier of the client record. Any
    leading and trailing as well as duplicate whitespace characters
    will be removed before the label is stored in the system.

  ## Notes

    - visible_projects are those projects which have the visible flag
    set.
